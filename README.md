HuntingJupiter
====
A 2-Player networked racing game.  Two spaceships race through a field of somehow square-shaped asteroids with
the occasional warp tunnel to help them on their way to Jupiter.

Unfortunately the uploaded jar file has no audio because the jar file with the audio surpasses
GitHub's file size limit.

Featuring Gustav Holst's "Jupiter."

Uses David Eck's netgame/common package (http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/).
